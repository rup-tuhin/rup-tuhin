- 👋 Hi, I’m Rup Majumder.

 	Over a span of 10 yrs in the IT industry, I worked majorly as a Backend Software developer.
	
  I worked in Java, Spring boot, Web MVC. I have knowledge of RDBMS(Oracle) & NoSQL Database(Cassandra). 

  I have used Hibernate as the ORM tool for the DB interaction.

  I have worked in SOA & Microservice Architecture.
  I am following [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/) as the guiding principle of my architecture style.

  I follow Test Driven Development, [SOLID principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) & Agile methodologies while developing applications.

	I am influenced by Martin Fowler <https://martinfowler.com/>.
